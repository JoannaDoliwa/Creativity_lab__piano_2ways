Project description
----------
The project is Arduino-based and consists of two parts:
1. **Piano 1**  
   A 8-note piano with "keys" made of tin foil, based on the principle of capacitive touch. A sound of assigned frequency is made upon touching the tin foil keys.
2. **Piano 2**  
   A 5-note piano with 3D-printed keys attached to physical buttons. A sound of assigned frequency is made upon pressing the keys.

Materials and tech used
------
**Piano 1**  
- Arduino Uno
- buzzer (add description)
- wires (add description)
- 10kÎ© resistors
- tin foil
- BreadBoard

**Piano 2**
- Arduino Uno
- buzzer (add description)
- wires (add description)
- buttons (add description)
- 3D-printed PLA keys
- BreadBoard

State of the art
------
Both devices can be used to play simple melodies and the code can be easily adjusted for them to be "tuned" to different frequencies and hence to operate in other musical scales.

What's next
------
Due to their small scales the devices fit into the fMRI scanners and hence might be used in neuroscience research on the neural response to playing a musical instrument.
